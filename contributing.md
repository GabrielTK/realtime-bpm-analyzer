## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Allegro Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [d.lepaux@gmail.com](mailto:d.lepaux@gmail.com).

## Before Submitting an Issue

First, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/dlepaux/realtime-bpm-analyzer/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction:

üëç - upvote

üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, submit an issue using the guidelines below.

### Submitting an issue (bug)

* Be as clear and concise as possible.
* Do not submit more than one bug in a single issue.
* Clearly explain the following:

1. Action taken (what you did)
2. Expected result (what you hoped would happen)
3. Actual result (unexpected outcome)
4. Your setup (any and all relevant technical facts, error messages, logs, etc)

### Feature requests

* First consider if **you** yourself might be able to work on the feature? If so, check out info on contributing code below.
* If you do not have the skills, then please take the time to clearly think through the request. Is is appropriate for all users of Lazarus? If so, create a new issue containing the following:

1. Write `[request]` as the first item in the title, followed by a short, concise description, eg: `[request] Analyze streams`.
2. Fill in details explaining your request. Be as clear and concise as possible and only 1 request at a time.
3. Add mock-ups, etc as needed to clearly demonstrate the idea.

## New Feature and code contributions

Things to take into consideration when submitting a pull request:

 - Please submit all pull requests (except for hotfixes) to the [develop branch](https://github.com/dlepaux/realtime-bpm-analyzer/tree/develop).
 - Please keep current code styling in mind (handled with xo).
